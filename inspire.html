        <p><font size="smaller">Jonathan Sims is a writer, performer, and games designer whose work primarily focuses on the macabre, the grotesque, and the gentle touch of creeping dread. He is the mind and the voice behind acclaimed horror podcast <em>The Magnus Archives.</em> </p>
        <p>Johnathan Sims helped build <em>Rusty Quil</em>, which is now a worldwide independent leading production company. Alexander Newell (the founder of <em> Rusty Quil</em>) took a chance on a guy he casually knew. Now <em>The Magnus Archives</em> has a cult-like following that backed a spin-off called <em> The Magnus Protocol</em>. Johnathan Sims puts everything into his podcasts and books. It is very inspiring that he is this passionate about telling scary stories!</p>
