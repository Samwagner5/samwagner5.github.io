        <p>Hello I'm Sam! I have traveled this unique country for the last five years. I have lived in places like Denali, Alaska, Mt Rainier, the Grand Tetons, and Custer State Park, to name a few. With this travel, I have had a chance to cook in various restaurants! I am now a Software Engineering major, and I hope to travel again soon! </p>
